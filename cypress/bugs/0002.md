### Summary: 
Unable to create a new product on the admin dashboard

#### Steps:

* Login as an admin to the dashboard [admin login page.](https://pet-shop.buckhill.com.hr/login)
* Once logged in, navigate to the products page
* Click on 'Create new product' button to create a new product
* Fill in the product fields and upload an image for the product
* Click on 'Save changes' button to create a new product
* Fill out & submit the form using the admin credentials. (admin credentials goes here)

#### Expected behavior: 
A new product should be created.
API: can be confirmed through the Network tab in the browser - expected status code: 200
UI: modal should close automatically and the products table should have the new product listed

#### Actual behavior: 
Modal remains open and the API call response is 422 (error: Undefined array key "category_uuid)

#### Additional information:
Upon further tests, seems to work as expected when tested via the API independently from the UI.
